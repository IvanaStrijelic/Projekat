# Projekat

For this project has been used TestNG, POM and ApachePOI.

Reasons for using of these tools:

TestNG provides parallel execution of test methods. It allows to define dependency of one test method over other method. It allows to assign priority to test methods. It allows grouping of test methods into test groups.

Apache POI (Poor Obfuscation Implementation) is an API written in Java to support read and write operations â€“ modifying office files. 

POM is the basic structure of Page object model framework where all Web Elements of the AUT and the method that operate on these Web Elements are maintained inside a class file. A task like verification should be separate as part of Test methods. It's used for enhancing test maintenance and reducing code duplication.
